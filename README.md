# Cognitive-Science-NOT-Final-Project
This is not the final project don't mess it up!!

To Do (Coding Part):
- make a function that shows the user a potential, and asks if it is valid or not
- make a function that, when the correct answer is given, the user is able to choose the path they want to take and add a point
- make a function that, when the wrong answer is given, the user either loses 1 point or gains no points and they move backwards in the maze
- make function that keeps track of response time
- Note: factor in word frequency

To Do (Writing Part):
- make a shared doc and outline basic parts of project
